Backing‚Äêup Canvases Using PyTower
=================================

Once PyTower is installed, navigate to the directory containing the saves you wish to back-up

Open command line and type ``cd <PATH>``, where ``<PATH>`` is the path to the directory. To get this on Windows, click the top bar of the file explorer ("This PC > ..." etc.). Clicking should reveal text that you can copy and paste into the command line, for example ``cd C:\Users\[...]\Documents\Tower Unite\PyTower``. Hit enter after typing the ``cd`` command

After running the ``cd`` command the directory should show next to the command line cursor. From here, run the PyTower command ``pytower backup save <FILENAME>``. This will attempt to download all canvases from their URLs. Once the process is complete, the backup will be available in the main PyTower directory inside the ``backup`` folder.
